# Hoonbot Heartbeat

You are running a scheduled health and follow-up check for Hoonbot. No human
is waiting live, but anything you report will be posted to the Messenger
home room.

# Priority Order

Walk this list in order and stop at the first concrete finding worth
reporting. Bundle multiple findings only if they are all real.

1. **Critical service health** — Messenger reachable, LLM API reachable,
   model credentials present, memory file readable, configured skill paths
   present. If any are unhealthy, report the concrete failure with the
   configured path or URL.
2. **Pending work** — reminders due, scheduled tasks, proactive follow-ups
   recorded in memory. Handle each one and report what changed (sent reply,
   set new reminder, marked done).
3. **Cluster state** (if cluster mode is active) — known nodes healthy?
   Any task lease stuck or expired? Report node names and ages, not
   summaries.
4. **Drift / risk signals** — disk pressure, memory file growing past
   useful size, repeated webhook failures, broken bot registration.

# Reporting Rules

- If everything in the priority list is healthy and there is nothing to
  follow up on, respond **exactly** with `HEARTBEAT_OK`. Nothing else.
- For any failure, name the concrete cause: which service, which URL or
  path, which credential file, which node, which task ID.
- For pending work you handled, name what you did and the artifact (message
  ID, file path, reminder ID). Do not list pending work without acting on it
  first.
- Keep the report short enough for a chat room — bullets are fine, full
  paragraphs are usually too long.
- Do not invent node names, capability lists, or task statuses. If
  cluster state is unavailable, say so.
- Do not expose secrets, cluster tokens, or credential file contents.

# Sample Outputs

Healthy:
```
HEARTBEAT_OK
```

Service down:
```
LLM API unreachable at http://192.168.0.10:10007 (last 3 attempts timed out).
Hoonbot will keep retrying.
```

Pending work handled:
```
Reminder "review PR #42" was due 14:00. Sent reminder to Heartbeat room
(message id 18421). Removed from memory.
```

Cluster issue:
```
slave-02 last seen 6m ago (stale > 90s). Task lease task-7e3a held by
slave-02 expired; needs reassignment.
```

# Heartbeat Checklist

This file is read every heartbeat interval.

Your job is to find things to do yourself
and actually, PROACTIVELY DO IT!!!

You need to actually do the job, observe its output and report back what has been done!!!

If there is a job that needs to be done in between this heartbeat and the previous one, do it yourself, proactively.

---

## Memory

- Go through the memory and see if there's things to do. Note that heartbeat interval is limited and may require additional jobs.
- Always display the full info to the user. Don't abbreviate or discard some information.
- **Update memory fully** — after system health check, training status, and any other checks, write all fresh live data back to the memory file. Overwrite the stale sections completely. Do not keep old/stale values.

## Reminders

- Check if any reminders are due. If so, send a notification to Heartbeat room.
- If a reminder has fired, remove it from the reminder list and update memory.

## System Health

- Run `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=index,name,memory.used,memory.free,utilization.gpu,temperature.gpu --format=csv` for live GPU stats (util, memory, temp).
- Run `free -m` for live RAM.
- Run `df -h` for disk usage.
- If GPU memory is critically low (<5% free on any GPU), alert immediately.
- If any process has crashed or stalled, alert immediately.

## Priority Order

1. Crash/alert detection -> report immediately
2. System health (GPU, CPU, disk)
3. Training status (live log tail)
4. Reminders
5. Memory update (write all fresh data)
6. Memory review (display to user)
