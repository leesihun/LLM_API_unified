## Reminders

- Check if there are any important calendar events or deadlines coming up today
- Review any pending tasks from memory and report progress

## Daily Checks

- If memory hasn't been updated in more than 24 hours, note it
- If it's morning (06:00–10:00), give a brief good-morning summary of the day ahead

## Always

- If nothing needs attention, say so in one sentence
