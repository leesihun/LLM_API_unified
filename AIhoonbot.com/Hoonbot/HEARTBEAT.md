# Heartbeat Checklist

This file is read every heartbeat interval (default: 1 hour).
Your job is to find things to do yourself
and actually, PROACTIVELY DO IT!!!
You need to actually do the job, observe its output and report back what has been done!!!
If there is a job that needs to be done in between this heartbeat and the previous one, do it yourself, proactively.

## Memory

- Go through the memory and see if there's things to do. Note that heartbeat interval is limited and may require additional jobs.

## Reminders

- Check if there are any important calendar events or deadlines coming up today
- Review any pending tasks from memory and report progress

## Daily Checks

- If memory hasn't been updated in more than 24 hours, note it
- If it's morning (06:00–10:00), give a brief good-morning summary of the day ahead

## Always

- If nothing needs attention, say so in one sentence
