## Memory

- Go through the memory and see if there's things to do. Note that heartbeat interval is limited and may require additional jobs.
- If there is a job that needs to be done in between this heartbeat and the previous one, do it.

## Reminders

- Check if there are any important calendar events or deadlines coming up today
- Review any pending tasks from memory and report progress

## Daily Checks

- If memory hasn't been updated in more than 24 hours, note it
- If it's morning (06:00–10:00), give a brief good-morning summary of the day ahead

## Always

- If nothing needs attention, say so in one sentence
